Script on Factors Influencing Pet Adoption Likelihood

Objective:
To identify the key factors that make pets more likely to be adopted, based on data from the adopted_pets view.

Note: High likelihood of adoption = 1, Low likelihood = 0.


CREATE VIEW adopted_pets AS
SELECT 
s.PetType, 
       s.Breed, 
       h.PreviousOwner, 
       h.AdoptionLikelihood, 
       h.Vaccinated,
       h.HealthCondition,
       h.TimeInShelterDays
FROM adoption_data AS a
INNER JOIN pet_house AS h  
ON a.PetHouseId_fk = h.PetHouseId
INNER JOIN pet_species AS s
ON s.Species_id = h.SpeciesID_fk
GROUP BY 1, 2;



1. Pet Type and Breed Trends

A. The most adopted pet specie:

SELECT PetType, COUNT(*)
FROM adopted_pets
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;



1b. Most popular dog breed:

SELECT PetType, Breed, COUNT(*)
FROM adopted_pets
WHERE PetType = "Dog"
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 3 DESC;



1c. Most adopted breed for all pets:

SELECT PetType, Breed, COUNT(*)
FROM adopted_pets
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 3 DESC;



2. Vaccination and Health Status Impact
Note: Vaccinated, 1 = vaccinated; 0 = not vaccinated.
      Health condition: 1 = Bad , 0 = Good

Query:
SELECT Vaccinated, HealthCondition, SUM(AdoptionLikelihood) AS HighAdoptionLikelihood
FROM adopted_pets
WHERE AdoptionLikelihood = 1
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 3 DESC;


3. Time in Shelter:

SELECT AdoptionLikelihood, AVG(TimeInShelterDays) AS AvgTimeInShelter
FROM adopted_pets
GROUP BY AdoptionLikelihood;


4. Previous Ownership Impact
Previous Owner: 1 - Yes, 0 - None

Query:
SELECT PreviousOwner, 
       COUNT(*) AS TotalPets, 
       ROUND(SUM(AdoptionLikelihood) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) AS AdoptedHighPercent
FROM adopted_pets
GROUP BY PreviousOwner;
